### **Git hooks** are scripts that run automatically every time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Gitâ€™s internal behavior and trigger customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle.

Hooks reside in the .git/hooks directory of every Git repository. The built-in scripts are mostly shell and PERL scripts, but you can use any scripting language you like as long as it can be run as an executable. The shebang line (#!/bin/sh) in each script defines how your file should be interpreted. So, to use a different language, all you have to do is change it to the path of your interpreter.
